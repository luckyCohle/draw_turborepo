# Draw Together :rocket: :art:

## A Real-Time Collaborative Drawing App

Super excited to share something I've been working on—a real-time collaborative drawing app built from scratch using HTML5 Canvas, Next.js, Express, and WebSockets!

Basically, you can draw on your screen, and whatever you sketch instantly appears on your friends' screens. No fancy libraries for rendering—just raw Canvas and some WebSocket magic! :fire:

## What I Built :hammer_and_wrench:

- ✅ Real-time collaboration – Draw together, no delays
- ✅ Pure HTML5 Canvas – No external libraries, just raw drawing power
- ✅ Turbo Repo for a clean monorepo setup – Organizing frontend, backend, and WebSockets
- ✅ Next.js & Express – Fast and efficient
- ✅ WebSockets for live updates – Low latency, super smooth

## How It Works :dart:

1. Open the app and start drawing
2. Share a session link with friends
3. Watch the magic happen in real-time! :sparkles:

This project taught me a lot about real-time syncing, WebSockets, and managing a monorepo efficiently. Looking forward to adding more features!
